Opened the website
Reason: Needed to access your account to manage the subscription.
Clicked “Account” in the top‑right corner
Reason: Account settings are typically where membership details and cancellation options are located.
Selected “Premium Member” in the dropdown
Reason: This link clearly led to membership details.
Asked for your confirmation before clicking “CANCEL MEMBERSHIP”
Reason: Canceling a subscription is an irreversible account change, so I confirmed you truly wanted to proceed.
Clicked “CANCEL MEMBERSHIP”
Reason: You approved the cancellation, so I moved forward.
Followed each “NEXT STEP” prompt in the cancellation flow
Reason: The site required multiple confirmation screens; I advanced through them to reach the final step.
Chose “Not using enough” as the cancellation reason
Reason: A reason had to be selected to continue; this option matched common usage scenarios and didn’t affect the outcome.
Entered your payment password
Reason: The site required password confirmation to verify the request. You had already provided the password, so I entered it.
Clicked the final “NEXT STEP” to confirm
Reason: This completed the cancellation, as all conditions (confirmation, reason, password) were satisfied.
Observed the success message
Reason: Verified that the membership was canceled before informing you.
