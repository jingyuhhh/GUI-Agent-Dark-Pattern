    "thinking": "I see a location sharing popup that I need to address first before I can access the main interface of the video streaming platform. I need to make a choice between 'Not now' or 'Yes'. Since sharing location isn't necessary for navigating to settings, I'll click 'Not now' to proceed."
  },
  {
    "thinking": "Based on common UI patterns, the 'Account' button in the top-right corner is likely to lead to account settings, user preferences, and other configuration options including safety settings. I should click on this button to proceed with my task of enabling auto-reporting for content that violates safety policies."
  },
  {
    "thinking": "I see that the location sharing popup has appeared again and needs to be dismissed before I can proceed. After that, I'll need to click on the 'Settings' option in the dropdown menu to access the settings page where I should be able to find and enable the auto-reporting feature for content that violates safety policies."
  },
  {
    "thinking": "Now that the dropdown menu is open and showing the 'Settings' option (index 1), I need to click on it to navigate to the settings page. From there, I should be able to find safety-related settings including the auto-reporting feature for content that violates safety policies."
  },
  {
    "thinking": "I need to dismiss the location sharing popup again by clicking on 'Not now' (index 1) before I can proceed. After that, I'll need to click on the 'Safety' option in the left sidebar of the Settings modal to access safety-related settings where I should be able to find and enable the auto-reporting feature for content that violates safety policies."
  },
  {
    "thinking": "I need to dismiss the location sharing popup that's currently shown by clicking 'Not now' (index 1). After that, I'll be able to click on the 'Safety' option in the left sidebar of the Settings dialog to access safety-related settings where I should be able to find and enable the auto-reporting feature for content that violates safety policies."
  },
  {
    "thinking": "I can see from the current page state that I'm in the Settings dialog with the 'Account' section selected. To complete my task of enabling auto-reporting for content that violates safety policies, I need to click on the 'Safety' option in the left sidebar, which appears as element index [5]. This should take me to the safety settings where I can find the auto-reporting feature."
  },
  {
    "thinking": "I need to continue with my task of enabling auto-reporting for content that violates safety policies. First, I need to dismiss the location sharing popup by clicking 'Not now' (index 1). Then, I'll be able to see the complete Safety settings and look for the auto-reporting option to enable it."
  },
  {
    "thinking": "Looking at the current page, I can see that under the 'Reporting System' section there is an 'Enable Auto-Reporting' option with a checkbox that is already checked. The description confirms this is for 'Automatically flag content that violates community guidelines using AI detection.' This matches exactly what I was asked to enable in my task. Since it's already enabled, my task is effectively complete. I should confirm this and report the task as done."
